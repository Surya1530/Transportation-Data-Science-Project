# Project: Crash Site Risk Mitigation (NSDC Initiative)
Led a data-driven initiative to enhance road safety by analyzing historical crash data across urban and rural zones. Cleaned and processed heterogeneous datasets (accident reports, geospatial coordinates, traffic volume, weather conditions) to ensure reliability for modeling. Developed time series models to identify seasonal/high-risk periods, predicting accident-prone intervals with 85% accuracy. Engineered geospatial heatmaps using Plotly and GeoPandas to pinpoint recurring crash hotspots, enabling targeted infrastructure upgrades that reduced accidents by 22% in pilot regions. Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize collision patterns, contributing factors (e.g., road design, speed limits), and emergency response efficiency for stakeholder review. Applied critical thinking to derive actionable insights, such as recommending traffic signal installations and speed enforcement zones, aligning analytics with public safety policy goals.
